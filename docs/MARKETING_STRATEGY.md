Title: I built a 100% local RAG system with one-command setup [Open Source]

Been working on this for X months. It's a complete RAG pipeline that:
- Runs entirely on your hardware (Ollama + Qdrant)
- Sets up with a single command
- Processes PDFs, DOCX, images with OCR
- Has multi-user auth and role-based access
- AGPL licensed (open source that stays open)

Demo: [video link]
GitHub: [link]
Docker setup: ./setup.sh standard

Would love feedback from the community!

I built an open-source RAG system for businesses that can't use cloud AI.

Key features:

It uses Ollama for LLM, Qdrant for vectors, and FastAPI/React for the stack.

Looking for feedback on the architecture and any security concerns.

#RAG #SelfHosted #OpenSource
```

```
Why I built RAG Enterprise with AGPL license:

☁️ Cloud RAG: Your documents on someone else's server
🏠 RAG Enterprise: Your documents, your server, your control

No vendor lock-in. No data leakage. Just RAG.
